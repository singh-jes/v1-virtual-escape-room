  <p>Congratulations on passing your first test, agent. The rick roll test is truly one of the greatest predictors of technology adeptness on the internet. <br> <br>
		However, in an abundance of caution, we’ve incorporated another test onto this page to test to make sure you are up to the caliber we require. <br> <br>
		We understand if you're not up to the task; please do not submit your resume. If you cannot figure out this challenge, your services are no longer required. We've taken the liberty of providing a door for you, so you can imagine us showing you the door (because we don't want your help): <br><br>

			Nicely done Agent. We are Super Hidden Important Task Force, or SHIT-F for short, a group of retired agents from across the federal government that have joined forces to prevent Donald Trump from getting away with financial crimes. Since the recent report we’ve been digging into Trump’s debt and have just received word that his team is meeting Deutsche bank later today to erase his debt and delete all the evidence! He must have been threatening to regulate them for years and they’ve finally given in. <br> <br>

			Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to get into his accounts and grab as much information as you can about his transactions before it’s too late. We NEED to have evidence of his debt, or he’ll claim it never existed… <br> <br>

			Here’s what we know: <br><br><br>

			Trump logged on to the Trump Tower’s public wifi network, so we were able to get ahold of the following message and photo, but the message is encrypted and we have no idea what this photo means! I’ve heard the trump tower’s encryption systems are quite weak though, so I’ve taken the liberty of getting in touch with the security expert. I didn’t really understand what he said, but it had something to do with this guy named Blaise de Vigenère or something… you’ll have to dig through and figure it out. <br><br>

			Here are the files:<br> <br>
			Trump's text message: <br>
			JJQM! M XXTIVWS BIX LWR QSGARGX LWVBK XDE GIFSVBK KTPFIL BRGWSVRG! ML'H POPDTQ GXWVNBSYGNDLQ!<br> <br>
			Trump's photo: <a href="https://shit-f.netlify.app/so-delicious.jpg" download="">Click to download</a> <br> <br>

			Let us know at rabbit.snake.turtle@gmail.com if you are able to make anything of this. Best of luck.<br> <br>
